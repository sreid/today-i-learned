# NetHogs for Per-Process Network Usage

Need to figure out how much network bandwidth a Linux process is using? Try https://github.com/raboof/nethogs
```
sudo nethogs
```
Measures network usage per process while it's running. Install using apt-get, but if you get an error, try compiling the latest version which has additional fixes (v0.8.1 as of writing)

Pro Tip: Press the "m" key to cycle modes (such as cumulative measurements).
