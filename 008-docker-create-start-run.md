Exact details still to be worked out, but it's extremely helpful to know that:

```
docker run = docker create + docker start
```
see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/42039994

and if you're using `docker-compose`, then 
```
docker-compose up = Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
```
from: https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/
